No Tables have been published for converting AUC into other frequently used effect size indexes, such as OR and Ln(OR). In this article, two Tables for 500 AUC three-digit values provide the equivalent values for converting AUC into four ESs, including Cohen's d values, Pearson's rpb, odds-ratio (OR), and Ln(OR). In the case of rpb, the values are given for four base rates (.5, .3, .2, and .1). In addition, the formulas for transforming AUC into these effect sizes are provided, so researchers can calculate other values which have not been included in the Tables.},

abstract = {Background
Pressure ulcers are serious, avoidable, costly and common adverse outcomes of healthcare.
Objectives
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a patient-centred pressure ulcer prevention care bundle compared to standard care.
Design
Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of pressure ulcer prevention performed from the health system perspective using data collected alongside a cluster-randomised trial.
Settings
Eight tertiary hospitals in Australia.
Participants
Adult patients receiving either a patient-centred pressure ulcer prevention care bundle (n=799) or standard care (n=799).
Methods
Direct costs related to the intervention and preventative strategies were collected from trial data and supplemented by micro-costing data on patient turning and skin care from a 4-week substudy (n=317). The time horizon for the economic evaluation matched the trial duration, with the endpoint being diagnosis of a new pressure ulcer, hospital discharge/transfer or 28days; whichever occurred first. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the primary outcome was the incremental costs of prevention per additional hospital acquired pressure ulcer case avoided, estimated using a two-stage cluster-adjusted non-parametric bootstrap method. The cost-benefit analysis estimated net monetary benefit, which considered both the costs of prevention and any difference in length of stay. All costs are reported in AU$(2015).
Results
The care bundle cost AU$144.91 (95%CI: $74.96 to $246.08) more per patient than standard care. The largest contributors to cost were clinical nurse time for repositioning and skin inspection. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the care bundle was estimated to cost an additional $3296 (95%CI: dominant to $144,525) per pressure ulcer avoided. This estimate is highly uncertain. Length of stay was unexpectedly higher in the care bundle group. In a cost-benefit analysis which considered length of stay, the net monetary benefit for the care bundle was estimated to be −$2320 (95%CI −$3900, −$1175) per patient, suggesting the care bundle was not a cost-effective use of resources.
Conclusions
A pressure ulcer prevention care bundle consisting of multicomponent nurse training and patient education may promote best practice nursing care but may not be cost-effective in preventing hospital acquired pressure ulcer.}

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are localised
               skin injuries that cause significant mortality and are costly.
               Nursing best practices prevent pressure injuries, including
               time-consuming, complex tasks that lack payment incentives. The
               Braden Scale is an evidence-based stratification tool nurses use
               daily to assess pressure-injury risk. Our objective was to
               analyse the cost-utility of performing repeated risk-assessment
               for pressure-injury prevention in all patients or high-risk
               groups. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using Markov modelling
               from US societal and healthcare sector perspectives within a
               1-year time horizon. SETTING: Patient-level longitudinal data on
               34 787 encounters from an academic hospital electronic health
               record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily Braden
               scores. Supervised machine learning simulated age-adjusted
               transition probabilities between risk levels and pressure
               injuries. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalised adults with Braden scores
               classified into five risk levels: very high risk (6-9), high
               risk (10-11), moderate risk (12-14), at-risk (15-18), minimal
               risk (19-23). INTERVENTIONS: Standard care, repeated risk
               assessment in all risk levels or only repeated risk assessment
               in high-risk strata based on machine-learning simulations. MAIN
               OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2016 $US) of pressure-injury treatment
               and prevention, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) related
               to pressure injuries were weighted by transition probabilities
               to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at
               $100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay. Univariate and probabilistic
               sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. RESULTS:
               Simulating prevention for all patients yielded greater QALYs at
               higher cost from societal and healthcare sector perspectives,
               equating to ICERs of $2000/QALY and $2142/QALY, respectively.
               Risk-stratified follow-up in patients with Braden scores 99\% of
               probabilistic simulations. CONCLUSION: Our analysis using EHR
               data maintains that pressure-injury prevention for all
               inpatients is cost-effective. Hospitals should invest in nursing
               compliance with international prevention guidelines.",
