## Overview

predictNMB is a tool to evaluate (hypothetical) clinical prediction models based on their estimated Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). It may be used by prediction model developers who intend to find out how performant their model needs to be to be clinically useful or by those in health services deciding whether or not to implement an existing model.

`{predictNMB}` has two main functions: 

- `do_nmb_sim()`: takes user defined inputs for a given prediction model and population, then evaluates the NMB by performing simulations.
- `screen_simulation_inputs()`: calls `do_nmb_sim()` many times, using a range of values for any of its inputs. This is useful for sensitivity analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/predictNMB")

# or, equivalently:
install.packages("predictNMB", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Estimating model cutpoints

We must first define a hypothetical NMB associated with each square of a confusion matrix (2x2 table). To do this, we create an R function which, when run, returns a named vector representing the four NMB values that we need. `get_nmb_sampler()` is a `predictNMB` function that makes creating the function easier!

```{r}
library(predictNMB)

fx_nmb <- get_nmb_sampler(
  outcome_cost = 100,
  high_risk_group_treatment_effect = 0.35,
  high_risk_group_treatment_cost = 10
)

fx_nmb()
```

We can then pass this to the simulation function.
Required arguments:

- `n_sims`: number of simulations to run. More simulations take longer, but are more stable.
- `event_rate`: event incidence rate, or the proportion of patients experiencing the event.
- `sim_auc`: vector of hypothetical AUCs; e.g. `seq(0.7, 0.95, 0.05)` or `c(0.75, 0.80, 0.85)`.
- `n_valid`: number of samples the validation set draws within each simulation (evaluating the NMB under each cutpoint).
- `fx_nmb_training`: function that returns a named vector used to get cutpoints on the training set. Recommended to use constant values.
- `fx_nmb_evaluation`: function that returns a named vector used to get cutpoints on the evaluation set. Recommended to use sampled values.
- `cl`: (Optional) users can pass a cluster made using `parallel::makeCluster()`. If it is given, the simulations are run in parallel (faster).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores())
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(parallel)
chk <- Sys.getenv("_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES_", "")
if (nzchar(chk) && chk == TRUE) {
  ncores <- 2
} else {
  ncores <- detectCores()
}
cl <- makeCluster(ncores)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
sim_screen_obj <- screen_simulation_inputs(
  n_sims = 1000, n_valid = 10000, sim_auc = seq(0.7, 0.95, 0.05), event_rate = 0.1,
  fx_nmb_training = fx_nmb, fx_nmb_evaluation = fx_nmb,
  cutpoint_methods = c("all", "none", "youden"), cl = cl
)
```

These simulations can be interpreted as a range of hypothetical situations under different levels of model performance within our specific healthcare setting. We can visualise how this change may affect preferences between the model-guided strategy versus a treat-all or treat-none strategy — in other words, using the model to determine who should get treatment, rather than everyone or no-one.

`autoplot()` can be used on the object returned from this function to quickly inspect these trends:

```{r, message=FALSE}
autoplot(sim_screen_obj)
```

Here, we are visualising many simulations under different inputs. If we just want to inspect a single set of inputs, say when the model AUC is 0.9, we can run that simulation alone using `do_nmb_sim()`, or access it from our existing screen.

```{r, eval=F}
single_sim_obj <- do_nmb_sim(
  n_sims = 1000, n_valid = 10000, sim_auc = 0.9, event_rate = 0.1,
  fx_nmb_training = fx_nmb, fx_nmb_evaluation = fx_nmb,
  cutpoint_methods = c("all", "none", "youden"), cl = cl
)
```

```{r}
single_sim_obj <- sim_screen_obj$simulations[[6]]
```

When plotting a single set of simulation inputs, we see the distributions of the NMB across all simulations under each strategy. Note that we have added some tasteful themes using `theme_sim()` that help reduce clutter on these types of plots.

```{r}
autoplot(single_sim_obj) + theme_sim()
```
